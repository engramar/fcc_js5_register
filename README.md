# Cash Register
## Free Code Camp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

Currency Unit	Amount <br/>
Penny	$0.01 (PENNY) <br/>
Nickel	$0.05 (NICKEL) <br/>
Dime	$0.1 (DIME) <br/>
Quarter	$0.25 (QUARTER) <br/>
Dollar	$1 (ONE) <br/>
Five Dollars	$5 (FIVE) <br/>
Ten Dollars	$10 (TEN) <br/>
Twenty Dollars	$20 (TWENTY) <br/>
One-hundred Dollars	$100 (ONE HUNDRED) <br/>

See below for an example of a cash-in-drawer array: <br/>
[ <br/>
  ["PENNY", 1.01], <br/>
  ["NICKEL", 2.05], <br/>
  ["DIME", 3.1], <br/>
  ["QUARTER", 4.25], <br/>
  ["ONE", 90], <br/>
  ["FIVE", 55], <br/>
  ["TEN", 20], <br/>
  ["TWENTY", 60], <br/>
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100] <br/>
] <br/>
